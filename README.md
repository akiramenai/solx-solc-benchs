# üß™ solx vs solc ‚Äî Community Benchmark Suite

<p align="center">
  <img src="./solx-logo.png" width="200" alt="Solx vs Solc">
</p>

This repo allows developers to **benchmark and compare** how [`solx`](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx) performs against `solc` in terms of **output, performance, and compatibility**. The repository contains a list of projects and a script to run the benchmarks against local projects that you might have.

---


## üìã Requirements

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) for running the tests
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later) for building the dashboard
- Git for cloning and contributing

---

## üîç Testing Local Projects

You can test any local Foundry project without adding it to this repository running the `compare.sh` script with the `-project` flag:

```bash
# Test a project in a different directory
./compare.sh -project ../my-other-project
```

Requirements for local projects:

- Must be a Foundry project (contains `foundry.toml`)
- Should have tests that use the gas report feature
- The solc version will be read from your `foundry.toml`

The results will appear [in the dashboard](#-running-the-dashboard-locally) under the project's directory name.
