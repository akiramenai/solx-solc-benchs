# ðŸ§ª solx vs solc â€” Community Benchmark Suite

<p align="center">
  <img src="./solx-logo.png" width="200" alt="Solx vs Solc">
</p>

This repo allows developers to submit their own smart contracts to **benchmark and compare** how [`solx`](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx) performs against `solc` in terms of **output, performance, and compatibility**.

---

## ðŸš€ Purpose

We want real-world usage data. By submitting your own contracts (or forks of existing ones), you help us:

- Evaluate solx's compatibility with various existing contracts
- Benchmark solx vs solc compilation output
- Identify edge cases or gaps

---

## ðŸ§° Project Template

We provide a Foundry template in `/template-foundry-project` that includes:

- Basic Foundry configuration with both `solx` and `solc` compiler targets
- A test suite scaffold
- Integration with the comparison script

---

## ðŸ›  How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repository**

2. **Create your project from the template:**
   ```bash
   # Replace 'my-contracts' with your project name (e.g., erc20, nft-marketplace, etc.)
   cp -r ./template-foundry-project my-contracts/
   ```

3. **Add your contracts and tests:**
   - Place contracts in `my-contracts/src/`
   - Add tests in `my-contracts/test/`
   - Update `foundry.toml` if needed

4. **Setup solx compiler:**
   - Download the latest version from [the releases page](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx/releases)
   - Create and place it in the `./binaries-solx` folder:
     ```bash
     mv path/to/downloaded/solx-macosx-v0.1.0-alpha.3 binaries-solx/
     chmod +x binaries-solx/solx-macosx-v0.1.0-alpha.3
     ```
   - Update your project's `foundry.toml` to point to the binary:
     ```toml
     [profile.solx]
     solc_version = "../binaries-solx/solx-macosx-v0.1.0-alpha.3"
     ```

## ðŸ“Š Running Benchmarks

### Using the Compare Script

The `compare.sh` script automates the process of generating gas reports for both compilers:

```bash
./compare.sh my-contracts
```

This will:
1. Read the solc version from your project's `foundry.toml`
2. Extract the solx version from the binary path
3. Generate gas reports for both compilers in `reports/my-contracts/`:
   - `gas-report-solc-{version}.json`
   - `gas-report-solx-{version}.json`

### Viewing Results in the Dashboard

We provide an interactive dashboard to visualize the comparison results:

1. **Build the Dashboard:**
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   node build.js
   ```
   This will process all reports and generate the visualization data.

2. **View the Dashboard:**
   - Open `dashboard/index.html` in your browser
   - Select your project from the dropdown
   - View detailed gas comparisons for:
     - Contract deployment costs
     - Method-by-method gas usage
     - Multiple compiler versions (if available)

The dashboard features:
- Interactive charts showing gas usage comparisons
- Detailed deployment cost analysis
- Method-by-method gas usage breakdown
- Support for multiple compiler versions
- Color-coded visualization (purple for solc, blue for solx)

## ðŸ’¡ Guidelines

- You can add contracts you've written or fork existing open-source ones
- Keep submissions focused on one contract or suite per folder for clarity
- Prefer Solidity 0.8.x for now (matching current Solx compatibility)
- Be descriptive in your PR so others understand what you're testing
