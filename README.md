# ðŸ§ª solx vs solc â€” Community Benchmark Suite

<p align="center">
  <img src="./solx-logo.png" width="200" alt="Solx vs Solc">
</p>

This repo allows developers to submit their own smart contracts to **benchmark and compare** how [`solx`](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx) performs against `solc` in terms of **output, performance, and compatibility**.

---

## ðŸš€ Purpose

We want real-world usage data. By submitting your own contracts (or forks of existing ones), you help us:

- Evaluate solx's compatibility with various existing contracts
- Benchmark solx vs solc compilation output
- Identify edge cases or gaps

---

## ðŸ§° Project Template

We provide a Foundry template in `/template-foundry-project` that includes:

- Basic Foundry configuration with both `solx` and `solc` compiler targets
- A test suite scaffold
- Integration with the comparison script

---

## ðŸ›  How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repository**

2. **Create your project from the template:**
   ```bash
   # Replace 'my-contracts' with your project name (e.g., erc20, nft-marketplace, etc.)
   cp -r ./template-foundry-project my-contracts/
   ```

3. **Add your contracts and tests:**
   - Place contracts in `my-contracts/src/`
   - Add tests in `my-contracts/test/`
   - Update `foundry.toml` if needed

4. **Setup solx compiler:**
   - Download the latest version from [the releases page](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx/releases)
   - Create and place it in the `./binaries-solx` folder:
     ```bash
     mv path/to/downloaded/solx-macosx-v0.1.0-alpha.3 binaries-solx/
     chmod +x binaries-solx/solx-macosx-v0.1.0-alpha.3
     ```
   - Update your project's `foundry.toml` to point to the binary:
     ```toml
     [profile.solx]
     solc_version = "../binaries-solx/solx-macosx-v0.1.0-alpha.3"
     ```

5. **Run the benchmark:**
   ```bash
   # Run comparison for your project
   ./compare.sh my-contracts
   ```

   This will:
   - Create a `reports/my-contracts/` directory
   - Generate gas snapshots for both compilers
   - Create a detailed gas comparison report
   - Output files will include compiler versions in their names

6. **Submit a PR with:**
   - Your project folder
   - The generated reports
   - Any notes or known issues

## ðŸ’¡ Guidelines

- You can add contracts you've written or fork existing open-source ones
- Keep submissions focused on one contract or suite per folder for clarity
- Prefer Solidity 0.8.x for now (matching current Solx compatibility)
- Be descriptive in your PR so others understand what you're testing
